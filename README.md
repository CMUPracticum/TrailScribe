# TrailScribe

More than 40 years ago, the last humans to walk on the Moon used cuff  checklists and map books to stay on track. What will the next generation of lunar explorers use?

The primary goal of the TrailScribe project is to build an open source Android mapping application usable as an electronic field notebook to collect, share and view information in the field.
