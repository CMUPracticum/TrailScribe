This folder (/TrailScribe/TrailScribe/assets/samples) contains the images of the samples.

Currently the samples are created in SampleDataSource.java as examples.
On the other hand, sample images is copied from here to device storage.

After features to add/sync samples are implemented, samples will be created by users.
This folder, as well as the samples inserted in SampleDataSource.java should be removed once the features are implemented.
